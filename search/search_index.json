The message contains two new fields <code>exceptiontype</code> and <code>vendor</code>, so existing log collection systems might need to be adapted. (#291246)</li> <li>Logging: Added an optional trace log file for USP NAS Core and changed the log level of certain log statements (e.g. task start/finish) to \"trace\" in order to reduce verbosity. This will significantly reduce the size of the debug log and  make it easier to find relevant entries when debugging an issue. The trace log can be enabled by starting USP NAS core with the Java option <code>-Dtrace.logging.enabled=true</code>. The debug log events <code>CONFIG_UPDATED (1009)</code>, <code>START_CMDQUEUE_CHECK (1925)</code> and <code>CMDQUEUE_CHECK_COMPLETED (1926)</code> have been removed. (#291232)</li> <li>REST-API: CAUTION Soft-deleted netdevices are no longer included in the netdevice REST API response. The related filter parameters <code>deletedBefore</code> and <code>deletedAfter</code> have been removed. The interface REST API response will also no longer contain records belonging to soft-deleted netdevices.

(#291287)</li> <li>RADIUS: Fix reading and writing elliptic curve-based private key files when updating the FreeRADIUS configuration during USP NAS Core startup. (#291287)</li> <li>RADIUS: Fixed an issue in RADIUS request processing where a connection abort event with error type \"Object missing in context\" was logged when the related netdevice was of class SWITCH and had no netports assigned. Now the proper error type \"No netport defined\" will be logged and shown in connection events. (#291231)</li> <li>RADIUS: Fixed an issue where no connection abort events were shown for EAP requests in case of a RADIUS secret mismatch (#291220)</li> <li>RADIUS: Fixed an logging issue in the RADIUS message authentication validator in case of a shared secret mismatch. It no longer fails silently without creating a connection abort event when it is the first time a client device gets connected to a specific interface. When the netdevice is unknown and not part of a configured RADIUS subnet or out of scope, a RADIUS_AUTHENTICATOR_OUT_OF_SCOPE log event is created instead.
