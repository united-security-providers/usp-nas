The newline was removed in release 14.0 due to a replacement of the logging framework. If you are using USP NAS with a remote syslog server, we advise to validate the proper reception of log message sent by USP NAS. (#290890)</li> <li>If a WLAN AP/controller is being auto-added via RADIUS request subnet match, it will now get the device class WLAN instead of Generic RADIUS auth. device. This will ensure it is scanned in the correct way in case an SNMP access profile is defined. (#290840)</li> <li>When auto-adding via RADIUS request subnet match, no \u201cfake\u201d Generic Radius adapter is set anymore. The adapter will be set by the normal switch scan process, and the WebGUI will now show the correct status of the newly added netdevice.

(#290955)</li> <li>Fixed a data migration issue during release upgrade which occurred when no RADIUS subnets were defined (#290906)</li> <li>Fixed an issue in the portgroup mapping CSV data importer where a mapping was unintentionally assigned to an single interface by interface index, when using a wildcard character as interface name (%) to assign the portgroup to the entire netdevice.

It is now also ensured that manually defined netports are never overwritten or removed by the uplink matcher.

This could happed under certain circumstances when dealing with duplicate entries in the import file (#290878)</li> <li>Fixed the netdevice CSV data importer so that the default SNMP access profile is assigned to an entry if it requires SNMP but has empty community/username fields (#290877)</li> </ul>"}]}
