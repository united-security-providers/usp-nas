# USP NAS

The USP Network Access Service is the solution to many problems many organizations with a complex IT
infrastructure are struggling with:

* What devices are connected where? What about yesterday? Information about devices is incomplete
* No enforcement of keeping the IT inventory up-to-date
* Security measures are inadequate according to audits
* Lack of automation for the on-boarding of network devices
* Lack of know-how and/or resources for large-scale NAC projects

This results in a number of simple and clear requirements and solutions:

* Simple, clear and comprehensive solution
* Always provides transparency in realtime
* Every device is traceable and its history recorded
* Simple authentication of end devices
* The inventory process can be enforced automatically
* Short integration cycles with limited resource requirements
* High level of automation

USP NAS provides a central, scaleable solution, completely brand agnostic and without
the need for agents.
